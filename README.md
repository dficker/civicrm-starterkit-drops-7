CiviCRM Starterkit for Pantheon
===============================

The [CiviCRM Starterkit](http://civicrmstarterkit.org/) project is not intended to be installed on its own. Instead, you can quickly get started with CiviCRM by [spinning it up on Pantheon](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/products/civicrm_starterkit/spinup).

News
----

We are planning to switch soon (possibly in the next few weeks) to the latest version of CiviCRM 4.7.x. Now is a good time to switch since CiviCRM 4.7 is quite stable; is getting the majority of the new features; accounts for the majority of CiviCRM installs; and CiviCRM 4.6 is nearing its extended end of life. Perhaps the most important reason is that it is easier to support CiviCRM 4.7 in Pantheon since it is architected better for the particular requirements of Pantheon.

This switch will likely happen in the next few weeks, at which point you'll see the optional updates appear in the Pantheon dashboard. If you have any questions please contact us at [CiviCRM Starterkit](http://civicrmstarterkit.org/contact).

Updates
-------

This Pantheon upstream attempts to keep up to date with Pantheon's core Drupal 7 repository, with basic Drupal module security updates, and with updates to CiviCRM core long-term support version.

Versions
--------

The Starterkit is currently using CiviCRM 4.6.x long-term support (LTS) version.

Alternative
-----------

If you would prefer not to use this Starterkit--whether you already have a Drupal 7 website on Pantheon, you prefer to get the upstream updates directly from Pantheon--then you can also use the [minimially patched version of CiviCRM](https://github.com/freeform/civicrm-drupal-pantheon). This alternative requires a bit more work but provides CiviCRM 4.7 as an option. The [wiki](https://github.com/freeform/civicrm-drupal-pantheon/wiki) provides some steps on how to install it.
